# Free Electron Fraction

The free electron fraction is defined as
$$X_e = \frac{n_e}{n_e + n_H}$$, where $$n_e$$ and $$n_H$$ are the number densities of free electrons, protons, and hydrogen atoms respectively. The universe is neutral at the time of recombination, implying that $$n_e$$ is equal to $$n_p$$, the number density of ionized hydrogen atoms (isolated protons).

The free-electron fraction decreases during recombination ($$z \approx 1000$$), and increases again at reionization ($$z \approx 10$$).
