	abstract = {The precision of recent experiments such as \$\{{\textbackslash}it Planck\}\$ have allowed us to constrain standard and non-standard physics (e.g., due to dark matter annihilation or varying fundamental constants) during the recombination epoch. However, we can also probe this era of cosmic history using model-independent variations of the free electron fraction, \$X\_\{{\textbackslash}rm e\}\$, which in turn affects the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background. In this paper, we improve on the previous efforts to construct and constrain these generalised perturbations in the ionization history, deriving new optimized eigenmodes based on the full Planck 2015 likelihood data, introducing the new module 'FEARec++'. We develop a direct likelihood sampling method for attaining the numerical derivatives of the standard and non-standard parameters, and discuss complications arising from the stability of the likelihood code. We improve the amplitude constraints of the \$\{{\textbackslash}it Planck\}\$ 2015 principal components constructed here, \${\textbackslash}mu\_1=-0.09{\textbackslash}pm0.12\$, \${\textbackslash}mu\_2=-0.17{\textbackslash}pm0.20\$ and \${\textbackslash}mu\_3=-0.30{\textbackslash}pm0.35\$, finding no indication for departures from the standard recombination scenario. The third mode error is reduced by \$60{\textbackslash}\%\$. We utilise an efficient eigen-analyser that keeps the cross-correlations of the first three eigenmodes to \${\textbackslash}xi\_\{{\textbackslash}mu,{\textbackslash}mu'\}{\textless}0.1{\textbackslash}\%\$ after marginalisation for all the considered data combinations. We also propose a new projection method for estimating constraints on the parameters of non-standard recombination. Using our eigenmodes, this allows us to recreate the \$\{{\textbackslash}it Planck\}\$ constraint on the two-photon decay rate, \$A\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 2s1s\}=7.60{\textbackslash}pm0.64\$, giving an estimate to within \${\textbackslash}simeq 0.05{\textbackslash}sigma\$ of the full MCMC result. The improvements on the analysis using the \$\{{\textbackslash}it Planck\}\$ data will allow us to implement this new method for analysis with fundamental constant variations in the future.},

	abstract = {Cosmological parameter measurements from CMB experiments such as Planck, ACTpol, SPTpol and other high resolution follow-ons fundamentally rely on the accuracy of the assumed recombination model, or one with well prescribed uncertainties. Deviations from the standard recombination history might suggest new particle physics or modified atomic physics. Here we treat possible perturbative fluctuations in the free electron fraction, \${\textbackslash}Xe(z)\$, by a semi-blind expansion in densely-packed modes in redshift. From these we construct parameter eigenmodes, which we rank order so that the lowest modes provide the most power to probe the \${\textbackslash}Xe(z)\$ with CMB measurements. Since the eigenmodes are effectively weighed by the fiducial \${\textbackslash}Xe\$ history, they are localized around the differential visibility peak, allowing for an excellent probe of hydrogen recombination, but a weaker probe of the higher redshift helium recombination and the lower redshift highly neutral freeze-out tail. We use an information-based criterion to truncate the mode hierarchy, and show that with even a few modes the method goes a long way towards morphing a fiducial older \{{\textbackslash}sc Recfast\} \$X\_\{{\textbackslash}rm e,i\} (z)\$ into the new and improved \{{\textbackslash}sc CosmoRec\} and \{{\textbackslash}sc HyRec\} \$X\_\{{\textbackslash}rm e,f\} (z)\$ in the hydrogen recombination regime, though not well in the helium regime. Without such a correction, the derived cosmic parameters are biased. We discuss an iterative approach for updating the eigenmodes to further hone in on \$X\_\{{\textbackslash}rm e,f\} (z)\$ if large deviations are indeed found. We also introduce control parameters that downweight the attention on the visibility peak structure, e.g., focusing the eigenmode probes more strongly on the \${\textbackslash}Xe (z)\$ freeze-out tail, as would be appropriate when looking for the \${\textbackslash}Xe\$ signature of annihilating or decaying elementary particles.},

	abstract = {On large angular scales, the polarization of the CMB contains information about the evolution of the average ionization during the epoch of reionization. Interpretation of the polarization spectrum usually requires the assumption of a ﬁxed functional form for the evolution, e.g., instantaneous reionization. We develop a model-independent method where a small set of principal components completely encapsulates the effects of reionization on the large-angle E-mode polarization for any reionization history within an adjustable range in redshift. Using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, we apply this approach to both the 3 year WMAP data and simulated future data. WMAP data constrain two principal components of the reionization history, approximately corresponding to the total optical depth and the difference between the contributions to the optical depth at high and low redshifts. The optical depth is consistent with the constraint found in previous analyses of WMAP data that assume instantaneous reionization, with only a slightly larger uncertainty due to the expanded set of models. Using the principal component approach, WMAP data also place a 95\% conﬁdence level upper limit of 0.08 on the contribution to the optical depth from redshifts z {\textgreater} 20. With improvements in polarization sensitivity and foreground modeling, approximately ﬁve of the principal components can ultimately be measured. Constraints on the principal components, which probe the entire reionization history, can test models of reionization, provide model-independent constraints on the optical depth, and detect signatures of highredshift reionization.},
